; system-wide configuration file for file access policy
;
; format:
;     policy_class policy_type path_component process_name temporary_pid
;
; syntax: 
;     policy_class
;         watch    specify watch directories and operations (default: /Users/)
;                  anything that is not watched is automatically whitelisted
;         allow    allow any read operations matching this policy
;         deny     deny any read operations matching this policy
;
;     policy_type
;         prefix    policy applies to file/dirs matching prefix 
;             useful for things like SQLite databases with multiple files
;             can also use for directory prefixing
;         path      policy applies to file at direct path_component
;             use a slash at the end to indicate a directory prefix
;             using 'path', nested directories don't apply to the rule.
;             to apply nested directories also, use "prefix"
;         suffux    policy applies to file suffix path_component
;             can be used for extensions or folders in home directories
; 
;     path_component
;         the path component intended to match policy_type
;         must be encapsulates in quotes to accommodate spaces
;
;     process_name
;         policy applies to all processes matching process_name
;         must be encapsulated in quotes to accommodate spaces
;         use "any" to apply to all processes
;         use a slash at the end to indicate a path
;
;     operation
;         specify what operations should match this rule. if whitelisting a
;         path, you may choose to allow only read operations. if defining a 
;         for for a specific application, you may choose to allow the app 
;         read and write access. valid options are combinations of: rwc
;         read (r), write (w), create(c)
;
;         note: it's a good idea to let apps create their own files as
;             needed, unless you've special reason to restrict certain
;             folders from file creation (such as /Library/LaunchDaemons/)

; initial watch rules; these are the folders and operations we want to watch
watch prefix "/Users/" "any" rw
watch prefix "/Library/LaunchDaemons/" "any" wc
watch prefix "/Library/LaunchAgents/" "any" wc
watch prefix "/Library/Extensions/" "any" wc
watch prefix "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/" "any" wc

; allow all preferences files to be read
allow suffix ".plist" "any" r
allow suffix ".bundle" "any" r

; allow all system components to read and write (SIP protects these areas)
allow path "any" "/System/Library/" rwc
allow path "any" "/usr/libexec/" rwc
allow path "any" "/usr/sbin/" rwc

; let unix processes read certain files
allow path "$HOME/.profile" "/bin/bash" r
allow path "$HOME/.profile" "/bin/bash via /usr/bin/login" r
allow path "$HOME/.CFUserTextEncoding" "any" r

; many apps map libs into memory that store things in the keychain
allow suffix ".keychain-db" "any" rw
allow suffix "/login.keychain" "any" rw

; vim
allow path "$HOME/.vimrc" "/usr/bin/vim via /bin/bash" r
allow path "$HOME/.viminfo" "/usr/bin/vim via /bin/bash" r
allow suffix ".swpx" "/usr/bin/vim" rwc
allow suffix ".swp" "/usr/bin/vim" rwc

; lots of things talk to your history
allow path "$HOME/.bash_history" "any" rwc
allow path "$HOME/.lesshst" "any" rwc
allow prefix "$HOME/.bash_sessions/" "any" rwc

; .DS_Store files (ugh)
allow suffix "/.DS_Store" "any" rwc
allow suffix "/.localized" "any" rwc

; commonly accessed (innocuous) user folders
allow prefix "$HOME/Library/Logs" "any" rwc 
allow prefix "$HOME/Library/Preferences" "any" rwc 
allow prefix "$HOME/Library/FontCollections/" "any" r
allow prefix "$HOME/Library/Fonts/" "any" r
